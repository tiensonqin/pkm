title: Building A Second Brain
---

## - Creativity is borrowed - all about remixing ideas from other people into new ideas
- Brains are for having ideas, not storing - Capture ideas as soon as possible
- Idea recycling - Ideas are not single use, keep track of what we're creating and ideas for projects.
- Projects over Categories - don't categorise ideas, associate notes and ideas to a project.
- Slow burns - Create projects over time in the background, rather than struggle on a short period of time.
- Start with abundance - If you collect then you're never starting from zero.
- Intermediate Packets - blocks of information that form a greater work.
- You only know what you make - Ingesting books is one thing, but without a summary you've wrote then you'll never really internalise it.
- Make it easier for your future self - Put in the work now for the resource that'll help in the future. Don't assume your future self will know what you mean
- Keep your ideas moving - Don't overbuild your note taking system
