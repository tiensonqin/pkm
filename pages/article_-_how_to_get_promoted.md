## Rituals

- Phrase correctly, don't use bad delivery:
    - "Code can't ship until we spend 3 months refactoring" vs. "We really need to work towards paying off technical debt"
    - The "analog knob" - Tweak something rather than present a switch
- KPIs, OKRs, meetings and company values are performative rituals, don't assume they're actionable
- Must still perform the performative rituals
## Covert
### Grow at the rate the company does
### No failures in your area
### In summary, an opportunist's career advice is: ignore OKRs, switch projects well before the consequences of your decisions can be measured, act happy and easy-going, package bad news as appeals for slow systemic adjustments, don't make anyone look bad, perform rituals with enthusiasm, grow headcount faster than baseline, let work invent itself, follow management fashions, avoid acute failures, believe this sincerely.
