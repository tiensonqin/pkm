## Morning Tasks
### **What Did You Dream About?**
#### Nothing that I can remember
### **What Are You Thinking Now?**
#### I got up around 7am, and i've done nothing productive since. Jo is still in bed, i'm hungry and I think I need to get something to eat. I'm sure i'll have another "productive" day today, YT videos and nothing else. I should check my Etsy orders to make sure i'm up to date, then I can start summarizing some sources. Is my method really the best? Probably not, but we'll see when I come to write some new articles for caret.one. I'm sure that [[Roam]] would be better in the long run for networked thought, but for $15/month its not worth it in my opinion, especially since you can sort of do the same in [[Notion]] if you wanted to.
